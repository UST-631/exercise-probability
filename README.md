# Exploring Probability: Coin Flip Analysis

An interactive Jupyter notebook designed to introduce fundamental concepts of probability and statistical inference through hands-on experimentation with coin flips.

## Overview

This exercise guides you through building data generating processes, computing statistics, and using simulation to understand probability distributions. Through concrete examples of coin flipping, students learn to differentiate between random and non-random sequences and explore what makes certain outcomes "unusual."

## Learning Objectives

By working through this notebook, you will:

- Build functions to simulate random coin flips
- Create custom statistics to summarize data
- Use large-scale simulations (10,000+ trials) to understand probability distributions
- Determine how "extreme" or unusual specific outcomes are
- Differentiate between truly random sequences and human-generated "random" sequences
- Understand the relationship between sample size and variability
